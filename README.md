# CARLA-Computer-Vision-and-Classification

This repository contains materials for a course project focused on **traffic and object identification in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator using deep learning**.

The project explores how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) can be used to detect and classify objects in simulated driving environments, such as vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and road features.

## Project Overview

- CARLA was used as a simulation environment to represent real-world traffic scenarios.
- Deep learning models were trained on CARLA-based datasets to perform object detection and semantic understanding.
- Multiple approaches were evaluated, including CNN-only models and CNN/GNN hybrid models.
- The goal was to understand model performance, limitations, and applicability to real-time or autonomous driving systems.

## Repository Contents

- **Final Paper (PDF)**  
  A detailed report describing the project motivation, datasets, model architectures, experiments, results, and conclusions.

- **Figures and Results**  
  Visualizations and evaluation outputs included in the paper, such as accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

## Notes

- This repository is intended to document the **research and results** of the project.
- The focus is on experimentation, analysis, and learning rather than deployment.
- The paper represents the final deliverable for the course.
